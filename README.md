# SnekJS
**Experimental.**

>YES currently this is just a function..
This will probably become a class in the future,
but for now its only some experimentations on scroll linked effects.
Its about finding and testing logic to apply on elements,
in correlation with the scroll to create a range of cool effects.

A big parts of the function's based on css, the 'logic' we're applying on element's determined by its class

ATM its only works on (Chrome +66) because we're using CSS Typed OM

**I have done some test using regular CSSOM but the proccess speed is of course far behind CSS Typed OM, polyfill aren't ready yet, so this is purely experimental purpose, at least for now.**
